# Ship Dashboard
 
 A dashboard that allows the user to select and search a vessel of a given kind and pinpoint when and where that vessel sailed the longest distance between two consecutive AIS datapoints. It also displays static information about the vessel (e.g., flag, width) , as well as a comparative plot (how the vessel ranks among others of the same type).
 
 Implemented in R-Shiny with shiny modules.
