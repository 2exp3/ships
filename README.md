# Ship Dashboard
 
 A simple dashboard that allows the user to select and search a vessel of a given type to pinpoint when and where that vessel sailed the longest distance between two consecutive [AIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_identification_system) datapoints. It also displays static information about the vessel (e.g., flag, width), as well as a comparative plot showing how the vessel ranks among others of the same type.
 
 Implemented in [R-Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) with [shiny modules](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/modules.html).
